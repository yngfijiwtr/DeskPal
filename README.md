Raspberry Pi Zero LCD 16x2 Interactive Desk Screen
Refer to the pictures folder for demonstrations

A Raspberry Pi Zero W was used for this project running 32 bit Raspbian Lite.
I have attached a picture of my setup. And a general schematic from Adafruit's webpage.

I have added a text document with the linux commands I ran.

The program will autostart using Linux's crontab running a launch.sh shell file that runs the python3 program.
Bootup time on the Zero W was about 45 seconds.
